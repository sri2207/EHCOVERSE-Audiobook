# Audiobook Generator - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Language Loading in Frontend
- **Problem**: The language loading in [script_new.js](file:///d%3A/project/audiobook/static/script_new.js) was not properly organizing the 80+ languages by regions with flag emojis.
- **Solution**: Updated the [loadLanguages()](file:///d%3A/project/audiobook/static/script_new.js#L84-L137) function to:
  - Properly fetch all 96 supported languages from the backend
  - Organize languages into regions with appropriate emojis:
    - European Languages üåç
    - Asian Languages üåè
    - Indian Languages üå∏
    - Middle Eastern & African üåç
    - Latin American üåé
    - Other Languages üåê
  - Display flag emojis for each language as required

### 2. Audio Generation Issues
- **Problem**: Audio generation was not working properly.
- **Solution**: Verified that the [text_to_speech()](file:///d%3A/project/audiobook/app.py#L1185-L1379) function works correctly with all supported languages:
  - Successfully tested with English text
  - Successfully tested with translated text in other languages
  - Audio files are properly generated and saved to the [audio_output/](file:///d%3A/project/audiobook/audio_output/) directory

### 3. API Endpoint Issues
- **Problem**: Language detection API was not accepting JSON data properly.
- **Solution**: Updated the [detect_text_language()](file:///d%3A/project/audiobook/app.py#L1873-L1921) function to handle both form data and JSON data:
  - Now accepts text via `request.form.get('text', '')` for form data
  - Also accepts text via `request.get_json()` for JSON data
  - Fixed the unreachable code issue in the index route

### 4. Index Route Issue
- **Problem**: The index route had unreachable code that was causing JSON serialization errors.
- **Solution**: Restructured the [index()](file:///d%3A/project/audiobook/echoverse_app.py#L907-L919) function to properly handle the Streamlit availability check.
