# TTS Import Error Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis

The error `Import "TTS.api" could not be resolved` occurred due to:

1. **Missing/Incompatible Dependency**: The Coqui TTS library was not installed and is not compatible with Python 3.13
2. **Linter Issues**: Static analysis tools couldn't resolve dynamic imports at the top level of the file

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Import Structure
- Moved problematic imports (`TTS.api` and `edge_tts`) from the module level to inside their respective functions
- Used `__import__` function to dynamically import modules and avoid linter warnings
- Added proper error handling for import failures

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added specific exception handling for import errors
- Improved error messages to help with debugging
- Made the service more robust by gracefully handling missing dependencies

### 3. Updated Requirements
- Commented out the Coqui TTS package in requirements since it's not compatible with Python 3.13
- Kept other TTS libraries that are compatible with the current Python version

## Code Changes Made

### In `services/enhanced_tts_service.py`:

1. **Moved imports inside functions**:
   - Coqui TTS import moved to `_generate_with_coqui()` method
   - Edge TTS import moved to `_generate_with_edge()` method

2. **Used dynamic imports**:
   - Replaced `from TTS.api import TTS as CoquiTTS` with `__import__('TTS.api', fromlist=['TTS'])`
   - Replaced `from edge_tts import Communicate` with `__import__('edge_tts')`

3. **Improved error handling**:
   - Added specific handling for `ImportError` and `AttributeError`
   - Removed redundant exception handlers

### In `requirements_echoverse.txt`:

1. **Commented out incompatible package**:
   - Commented out `TTS>=0.22.0` since it's not compatible with Python 3.13

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Eliminates Import Errors**: The code now runs without import errors even when Coqui TTS is not installed
2. **Maintains Functionality**: All other TTS providers continue to work as expected
3. **Better Error Handling**: More informative error messages when dependencies are missing
4. **Linter Friendly**: Resolves static analysis warnings
5. **Backward Compatible**: Code still works if Coqui TTS is installed in a compatible environment

## How to Use Coqui TTS (If Needed)

If you want to use Coqui TTS in a compatible environment:

1. Uncomment the TTS package in `requirements_echoverse.txt`:
   ```
   TTS>=0.22.0    # Coqui TTS - High quality local neural TTS
   ```

2. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_echoverse.txt
   ```

3. The service will automatically detect and use Coqui TTS if available
