On glancing down at it, I observed that there was a slight fracture upon its surface;
and raising it to my lips, I detected a strong smell of bitter almonds.
The deduction was obvious. I sprang at the bell-rope, and pulled at it with all my strength.
The bell rang loudly, and a few moments later Dr. Watson entered the room.

"You have done some detective work of your own," said he, passing a sheet of paper to me.
"It is a report of the Coroner's inquiry into the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott."
    
    "And what did they make of it?"
    
    "Nothing. The gypsies have been arrested and examined, but nothing incriminating
    was found in their possession. They stoutly deny any connection with the matter,
    and the police are at fault. It is a most mysterious affair."
    
    "But you have formed your own conclusions?"
    
    "Yes, I fancy I can see my way through it all now."
    
    "And what do you propose to do?"
    
    "To call upon Mr. Windibank this morning, and to make a few inquiries."
    
    "But what if he refuses to answer?"
    
    "Then I shall have recourse to other measures.""
    
    "What are they?"
    
    "I shall wire to France for a copy of the police report, and I shall also
    write to the landlord of the hotel at which Roylott stayed."
    
    "And what then?"
    
    "We shall see what we shall see."
    
    With this cryptic remark, Holmes leaned back in his chair and began to hum a tune."""
